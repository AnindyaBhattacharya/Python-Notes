Python
Simpliest programming language
Example -1
to print hello world - 
print("hello world")
Example -2
perform addition-
a=10 (no neeed to assign any data type)
b=20
print(a+b)
print(a-b)
--------------------
Python is Dynamically type programming language - there is no need to assign any data type. python variables automatically adjusts itself to the data assigned.
Where as C & Java are Statically typed programming languages
>>> a=10
>>> type(a) --> this cmd is used to see the data type of a varible
<class 'int'>

>>> a=True
>>> type(a)
<class 'bool'>
The above examples prove so. One is adjusted to "int" another "boolean"
-----------------------
Names in Python is called Identifier. 
It can be any name be a variable name, class name , method name.
x=10, x is an identifier
Rule to declare a identifier
1.  can be alpha numeric, but not starting with numbers
2. case sensetive,  x=10, X=10 are two different variables
3. can have underscore ( _ ) character in variable name
4.should have any key words like - if , for, def etc.
5. should not have any special character like $,# etc.
