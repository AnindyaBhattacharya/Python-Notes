Python MultiPrcoessing
----------------------

MultiProcessing is quite similar to MultiThreading syntax wise. In multi-processing we use Process class and in multi-threading we use the Thread class.





Example -
-------

import os
import time

from multiprocessing import Process, current_process


def cube(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print(f"The number {number} cubes to {number*number*number}.")


def square(numbers):
    for number in numbers:
        time.sleep(0.5)
        print(f"The number {number} squares to {number*number}.")


if __name__ == '__main__':

    processes = []
    numbers = range(100)

    for i in range(100):
        process = Process(target=square, args=(numbers,))
        processes.append(process)
        process.start()

    for process in processes:
        process.join()

    print("Multiprocessing process complete")
