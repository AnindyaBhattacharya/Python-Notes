Python queue module. 
-------------------
Queue is a linear data structure that stores items in First In First Out (FIFO) manner. With a queue the least recently added item is removed first. 
First come first serve basis.

"queue" is a built-in module of Python which is used to implement a queue. 
queue.Queue(maxsize) initializes a variable to a maximum size of maxsize. 
A maxsize of zero ‘0’ means a infinite queue. 
This queue follows FIFO rule.

Functions od queue module.
--------------------------
from queue import *

q = Queue(maxsize = 3)          # declaring a queue with max number of elements = 3
q.empty()                       # returns True (if empty) False (if non empty).
q.full()                        # returns True (if maxsize is reached) False(if maxsize is not reached)
q.put("element")                # inserts element in the queue. If maxsize is reached,the code waits till a slot gets empty and inserts the element in that slot.
q.get()                         # fetches element from queue in FIFO order. If queue remains empty, the code waits till a slot gets filled and fetches that element
q.get_nowait()                  # fetches element from queue in FIFO order. If queue is empty raises error.
q.put_nowait("element")         # puts the element in the queue. If queue is full raises error.
q.qsize()			# returns current size of the queue.
q.get(block = False)		# performs same function as get_nowait()
