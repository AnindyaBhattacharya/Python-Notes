This is a way we can declare a class in Python and create an object form it.

class is the logical entity, which consists of the business logic. It represents a species(type) of business logic. 
object is the physical entity built out of the class. 
class is having the logics and the caracteristics. Object is the real physical entity having all the all the attributes defined in a class.
When there is a need to create some thing of similar nature, we create a class describing all the required characteristics. Then we can create multiple
object of same type, using the class.

For example to create humans god have created a class and have defined characteristics like, they will have 2 legs 2 hands they will talk walk jump etc etc.
And using these characteristics God creates real humans which are real objects (rokto mango er sorir). He created objects and gave reference variable name
like anindya, ila, anutosh etc etc.
